# AutoShellDown

AutoShellDown is my attempt at making an automated reverse shell that automates some basic boring stuff like: 

* setting up a python http server to host files
* setting up a python ftp server to exfiltrate data
* uploading and running linpeas.sh and other scripts

I made this so to speed up enumeration during privilege escalation on HackTheBox machines. This is very much a work in progress and I currently don't recommend using the experimental version of this script.
